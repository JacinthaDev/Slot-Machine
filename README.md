# âœ… Week05 Project: Avatar the Last Airbender Slot Machine

# Simple To-do List
This is my Avatar the Last Airbender theme Slot Machine. Since Aang is the avatar, if you spin and all 3 reels show him, you win big!

Will you be lucky enough to spin 3 Avatars?

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This slot machine starts you off with a bank of $1000. You can min bet ($5) or max bet ($50). However, my game isn't your traditional slot machine. Spin 3 Aangs - win 3x your current balance! Spin any 3 benders - 2x the winnings (Max betting can earn you 5x the winnings as a min bet)! Spin 3 Sokkas - you lose! You can also reset to start over. 

## Lessons Learned:
This was my first project working with so many JS functions at a time. It taught me that I must pseudocode so I know what's going on when. Something I forgot to do while I was coding was to make sure that there is a different winning multiplier depending on whether the user min betted or max betted. At first, I had the score calculating the same regardless of whether the user min or max bet. I was so deep into my code at that point and didn't know how to fix it without breaking my code so I duplicated my original turnReels function and made 2 of them so I could change the multiplier for the bets.
